A repository for exploring the evolutionary and ecological factors driving thiaminase production in fishes

## Data files

- [AllData.csv](<data/AllData.csv>) includes all ecological fish data
- [fishorder_skeletal.tre](<data/fishorder_skeletal.tre>) is the evolutionary phylogeny from [Rabosky et al. 2018](<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0273-1>) downloaded from <https://fishtreeoflife.org/>
- [BecanturTree.tre](<data/BecanturTree.tre>) is the tree I want to use for the phylogeny from [Betancur et al. 2017](<https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0958-3>) who also has a GitHub repository https://github.com/projectdigest/betancur_r-fish-tree/
- [OrderPresAbs.csv](<data/OrderPresAbs.csv>) is a csv file with presence of absence of thiaminase within each fish order in the Rabosky phylogeny
- [OrderPresAbsNA.csv](<OrderPresAbsNA.csv>) includes NA for orders not present in our dataset but are in the Rabosky phylogeny
- [data/Orders.csv](<data/Orders.csv>) a clean up file for matching orders from <https://fishbase.de> to orders in Rabosky. Should delete.
